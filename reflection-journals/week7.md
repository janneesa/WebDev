- Name: Janne Savinainen
  Rate: 4
  Justify Your Answer: I put in solid effort during coding marathon and pair programming but during the week i didnt do our project as much as i would have wanted. I have been coding the project more on the weekend

- Name: Mikko Saarela
  Rate: 5
  Justify Your Answer: Mikko performed very well during pair programming and coding marathon. He made code that didnt only just fill requirments but went over them also.

- Name: Samuel Puhakka
  Rate: 4
  Justify Your Answer: I feel like Samuel has been a little confused sometimes about how we divide tasks. He makes very good code but i think he is just super busy so it usually takes a long time for him to complete tasks unless its pair programming or coding marathon.

- Name: Roni Str√∂m
  Rate: 5
  Justify Your Answer: Roni has continued to put lot of effort in all of our tasks including pair programming, coding marathon and our project.

## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

I was still lightly tired this week but i had more energy to focus during classes. i didnt have much motivation or energy to code our project during the weekdays but during the weekend i coded lots of features

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I think during coding marathon 3 i gained more experience how a full stack app is organized and i learned how to deploy to render.

- Key Learning: Deploying to render

- Online Resources: no extra material this week

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress: We managed to complete all requirments for the coding marathon 3 and also during pair programming.

- Soft Skills Development: improved communication with group. on top of daily scrums we message alot in our group chat.

### Project Management:

communiction has been very important during these final days of the project. we have manged to update our progress with each others via messages and scrum meetings.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the coding marathon 3.

### Next Steps:

Next i am going to practice for the exam by making a simple fullstack app starter for my self and do as much coding for the project as i can.

## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

I was a bit tired this week and i couldnt fully focus all the time.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I worked on the backend during coding marathon and it was good since i got to recap backend stuff a bit more.

- Key Learning: JW Token and mongoose schema

- Online Resources: no extra material this week

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

We got perfect points for sprint 2 and coding marathon 2.

- Soft Skills Development:

During coding marathon 2 we were all really tired and we finished the project later on the evening after school ended so i think we all learned patience and how to keep calm even though we were all tired.

### Project Management:

managing project on trello and having daily scrums has been very helpful to keep everyone on track about the project.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of our groups effort in the coding marathon 2. we managed to deploy both front- and backend to render. I have been making good progress on my tasks regarding our project.

### Next Steps:

Next week im gonna try to rest more so i can fully focus on the school and learn everything there is to learn before the exam.

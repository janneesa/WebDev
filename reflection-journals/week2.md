## Reflection

### Challenges Faced:

There is lots of stuff to do in this course. I have not faced any challenges in coding. So far only challenge has been how to manage time between hobbies and watching the videos before lessons.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I think pair programming went well. My only challenges was to get the images to show.
That was because i forgot that the images had to be imported first. Learning React and Tailwind has been fun.

- Key Learning: I have learned lots of stuff like: Postman, React, using command line/git bash, figma and tailwind

- Online Resources: I started Tailwind css course and Figma course from O´REILLY.
  Also im planning to finish react 18 Tutorial video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flbw5BX_AX0.
  These online courses and resources have been very useful get more skills.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress: I have improved on my ability to learn. This course has very good idea to watch videos before lessons
  and then we learn more about them during the lectures and finally do activity. I think learning like this
  fits me very well.

- Soft Skills Development: I think I already have pretty good soft skills. I do need to maybe get better at
  getting my group members to talk more. Im working with the same people i was working last period so we have pretty good group spirit.

### Project Management:

I like the idea of SCRUM. I dont know if we are going to have daily scrum everyday, but lets see.
Making user stories seems to be good idea to start planning the project.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the pair programming and my effort to do Tailwind css course after school. I have not faced major challenges so far but, I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

### Next Steps:

For the upcoming week I am going to learn more tailwind and react.

## Peer assessment

Evaluate the performance of each member of your group. **Remember** to **evaluate yourself as well**!

- Name: Janne Savinainen
  Rate: 5
  Justify Your Answer: I have continued to learn more tailwind css and react. I am putting lots of effort in to group work and the project. During sprint 1 i made the wireframe and helped with the slideshow. we got very good feedback so i belive my effort was good.

- Name: Mikko Saarela
  Rate: 5
  Justify Your Answer: During sprint 1 mikko made most of the product backlog. I think hes effort was good and results very good aswell.

- Name: Samuel Puhakka
  Rate: 4
  Justify Your Answer: Samuels performance has been good, but i think he could have been better in terms of communicating. In example our group had agreed to do meeting at 12 o´clock. He messaged us 11:50 that we need to move it to 18 o´clock without any explanation. I understand that we all have our own schedules and sometimes "life happens" and schedules change, but i think he could have done that better by saying sorry and offering some type of explanation.

- Name: Roni Ström
  Rate: 5
  Justify Your Answer: Roni has been very good at cathing up after being away for the first week. He has been communicating very well also.

## Reflection

### Challenges Faced:

I had little difficulties with understanding middlewares and how to use them. but i watched a video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY6icfhap2o that helped me understand it a lot more. Also i think splitting express server files in to many components (MVC) had me little confused at the start, but it made sense at the end

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I learned what is middleware and how to use it in express server. I learned more about react and tailwind too. I am more confident in creating and styling components. For our project i find it easier to create pre-styled elements from tailwind classes. Example i create a single class for button in index.css that applies many tailwind classes at once.

In pair programming I was paired with Sasu. Clearly he had more experience in coding than me, but luckily i didnt face any big problems during the coding. Also he was helpful when i had some small mistakes. He was very fast at coding so maybe I would like to be paired with someone who likes to code a little slower.

- Key Learning: I think i have been putting most of my effort in to tailwind this week. I can understand tailwind classes now pretty well but creating pretty components still needs more practice.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

I have defenetly learned to plan projects and tasks better. For sprint 1 we got very good feedback and points.

- Soft Skills Development:

I think i have been communicating well with my group. I try to take a small group leader role as scrum master because my group members dont usually talk or tell their ideas unless i ask. So whenever i have an idea i try to ask everyones opinion about it.

### Project Management:

We had meeting about sprint 2. First it was hard to decide how we should move forward but we were able to divide interesting tasks to everybody. I think it was hard at first since nobody had anything to say or was afraid to say it. After i started asking what everybody wanted to do and presented ideas how we should maybe proceed we were able to complete the planning.

### Final Thoughts:

This past week has been very fun and i have learned lots of new stuff. I am proud of myself and my group members. We worked well during sprint 1 and i am excited to start sprint 2.

### Next Steps:

I am defenetly going to study more react during the next week. I am gonna take it easier with tailwind and focus on react components and jsx syntax.

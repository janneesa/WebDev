## Peer assessment

Evaluate the performance of each member of your group. **Remember** to **evaluate yourself as well**!

- Name: Janne Savinainen
  Rate: 5
  Justify Your Answer: My effort during group and pair programming has been very good and i belive others would agree. I did pair programming with Teemu and we did all the optional steps. Endresult was very good in my opinion. I had some schedule problems this week so i didnt have time to watch all the videos before lectures but i still managed to follow and learn.

- Name: Mikko Saarela
  Rate: 4
  Justify Your Answer: I feel like Mikko could have made a bit more effort for our project during this week. He made some good code at the end of the week, but like he said himself, it wasnt finished yet. We have 4 days left to finish sprint 2 so i hope me and mikko can finish the frontend on time. During group programming mikko performed very well

- Name: Samuel Puhakka
  Rate: 4
  Justify Your Answer: Samuel is doing backend for our project. We had agreed that on friday 15.11, everybody would show something thats ready. Samuel didnt have anything to shown. Now we agreed that he is going to do mongodb model, routers etc.. for predictions (posts that users can make in our social media project). I hope he can finish that for monday so we can focus on creating slide show for sprint 2 presentation. During group programming Samuel made some very good code.

- Name: Roni Str√∂m
  Rate: 5
  Justify Your Answer: Roni made early version for user model backend. It was well made. Now we agreed that he would refactor it to use mongodb and add some more data to the user. During group programming Roni performed well.

## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

I had some challenges with time-managment so i didnt fully watch all the videos i was meant to, but i was able to follow lectures and i learned all the new things. Backend is defenetly my weaker side because for our project i have been working on frontend so much. I need to recap some mongodb and backend structure stuff.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I really liked pair programming with Teemu. we had good communication and i think our endresult was very good. I have learned lots of new stuff about react.js and i am very comfortable using tailwind css

- Key Learning: Learning more react and useState. getting very comfortable with tailwind

- Online Resources: no online resources outside of school material this week.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

I am proud of my work on this week. I think my effort and performance has been good and i belive it shows in the code that i have made.

- Soft Skills Development:

Working with Teemu in pair programming was fun and easy. I didnt have problems communicating with Teemu. In our group programming session I learned that my group members really like to work more in silence. everybody was helpful to eachother if somebody needed help. In daily scrum meetings I have learned to lead the meetings better so i can get everybody to take more part.

### Project Management:

We have divided project to front- and backend sides and have 2 people working on both sides. workload is pretty even on everybody but i feel like not everybody is giving equal effort.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the pair programming and our project. I continue to put 100% effort to this course to learn everything.

### Next Steps:

I need to recap some backend stuff because i have been working with frontend so much.

## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

I faced some challenges during backend pair programming. It is defenetly because i have been working so much on the frontend

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I learned to hash passwords and how to handle login in the backend. I have learned to use useEffect and fetch data to the frontend.

- Key Learning: hashing passwords

- Online Resources: no extra online resources this week

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress: I improved on the backend during weekend because i did some recapping on backend.

- Soft Skills Development: I have learned to engage my group members more by asking them about their opinions more directly.

### Project Management:

Using Trello for project managment has been very good.

### Final Thoughts:

This week went by really fast and i didnt have time to recap backend as much as i would have wanted. Next week im going to recap more backend while learning new stuff about it. pair programming with Heta was fun. Project is in a very good shape.

### Next Steps:

Recap more backend and make some more time for schoolwork.
